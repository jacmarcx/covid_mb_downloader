# Manitoba COVID-19 data repo

> Update [2021-02-25]: I am no longer maintaining this repo. It is still running, but I can't vouch for the accuracy of the data harvesting past Jan 2021.

This app runs on Heroku and simply gathers up the Government of Manitoba dashboard data each night at 10 pm (Winnipeg time) and then pushes the new JSONs files to remote in the Github repository.

Note that a JSONs for October 4th and October 10th are missing due to an error a while back.

Note: thanks to Jean-Paul R. Soucy at the U of T for help with this.
